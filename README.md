## Description: 

In this project, We would check the quality of the pome fruits like apple,orange and sapota etc. without cutting them internally. 
we have used the multiple gas sensors and multispectral sensors for getting the data of different fruits and uploaded to the machine learning model to detect the quality of that fruits.
The integration of multiple sensors, including MQ-3, MQ-4, DHT11, Infrared (IR), Ultrasonic, and Sound sensors with an Arduino Uno on a breadboard to develop a non-destructive 
method for fruit spoilage detection. After this, it will outline the successful integration of the AS7265x spectral sensor with an Arduino Uno microcontroller to capture the
data on the serial monitor and display 18 different spectral readings using the serial plotter.

## Hardware used:

1. <ins>MQ3-Alcohol sensors:</ins>
The MQ-3 gas sensor is a crucial component in the field of gas detection and monitoring of fruit ripening condittions andspoilage through the emitted gases concentrations
like ethanol. This sensor is widely used in applications such as gas leakdetection,breath analysis, and industrial safety.

**Working Principle:**

The MQ-3 gas sensor operates based on the principle of semiconductor conductivity. It consists of a sensing element made of tin dioxide (SnO2),
which exhibits a change in electrical conductivity in the presence of specific gases. When the target gas comes into contact with the sensor,
it causes a change in resistance, leading to a measurable electrical signal.

2. <ins>MQ-4 Methane Gas Sensor:</ins>
MQ-4 is a type of gas sensor commonly used for detecting various gases in the environment, particularly methane (CH4), natural gas, propane, and other combustible gases.
When the fruits get spoiled it releases the significant amount of this gas in the nearby enviornment and we will measure that concentration of data which will help us identify the 
fruit quality check.
It operates on the principle of metal oxide semiconductors.

**Gas detection:**

When the sensor is powered on, the heating element heats the metal oxide semiconductor coating on the sensing element. In the presence of target gases such as methane or propane,
the conductivity of the metal oxide semiconductor changes. This change in conductivity is due to the chemical reaction between the gas molecules and the metal oxide surface.

3. <ins>MQ-135 Air Quality Gas Sensor:</ins>
The MQ-135 is a gas sensor widely used for detecting a variety of air pollutants such as ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), benzene, smoke, and other harmful gases.
the MQ-135 includes a built-in heating element, typically made of a fine coil of platinum wire. This heating element heats the sensing element to a specific temperature
(usually around 200-400Â°C) required for the sensor to operate.

**Output Signal:** 

The MQ-135 sensor provides an output voltage or current signal that is proportional to the concentration of the target gas in the environment. 
This signal can be processed and interpreted by a microcontroller
or other electronic devices to determine the presence and concentration of the gas.

4.<ins>DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor:</ins>
The DHT11 is a widely-used digital temperature and humidity sensor, known for its simplicity, affordability, and reliability.The DHT11 sensor is designed 
to measure both temperature and humidity in a single device, providing a convenient solution for environmental monitoring.

**Working Principle:** 

The DHT11 sensor operates based on a capacitive humidity 
sensing element and a thermistor for temperature measurement. The humidity sensing element measures changes in capacitance, while the thermistor 
measures temperature. The sensor converts these measurements into digital signals, providing accurate and easy-to-read data.

5.<ins>Infrared Sensor:</ins>
Infrared sensors are devices that detect and measure infrared radiation emitted or reflected by objects.

**Working Principle:**

Infrared sensors operate based on the principle that all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared radiation.
These sensors detect this radiation and convert it into an electrical signalthat can be interpreted by electronic devices.
The sensor then converts this radiation into an electrical signal, enabling the measurement and analysis of temperature or the presence of objects.

   </center>
6. <ins> Ultrasonic Sensor: </ins>
Ultrasonic sensors are devices that use ultrasonic sound waves to detect the presence, distance, and characteristics of objects in their vicinity.
Ultrasonic distance sensors measure the distance to an object and are often used inapplications such as parking assistance systems, liquid level measurement, 
and object detection in industrial settings.

**Working Principle:**

 Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves (ultrasonic waves) and measure the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back after hitting an object.
 By calculating the time taken for the sound waves to return and knowing the speed of sound in the medium, the sensor can determine the distance to the object.
 The basic setup includes a transducer that converts electrical energy into ultrasonic waves and vice versa.

7. <ins>Sound Sensor:</ins>
Sound sensors, also known as sound detectors or acoustic sensors, are essential components in various technological applications, enabling the detection and 
analysis of sound waves. A sound sensor typically consists of a microphone, a power amplifier, and an output actuator. The microphone converts the sound signal 
into an electrical signal, which is then amplified and processed by the power amplifier. The output actuator, such as a loudspeaker, converts the electrical signal
back into a sound signal for listening.

## Working Principle:

Sound sensors operate based on the conversion of acoustic waves into electrical signals. They typically consist of a microphone or a transducer that converts 
variations in air pressure caused by sound waves into electrical voltage. The generated electrical signal can then be processed and analysed for various applications.
